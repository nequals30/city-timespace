# stl_distance
Re-projecting the geography of St. Louis by travel time

Inspired by [Gradient Metrics'](http://gradientmetrics.com/) analysis [*New York City in Timespace*](http://gradientmetrics.com/new-york-city-in-timespace).

This will:
1) Connect to Google Distance API to pull down the travel distances between a bunch of coordinates in St. Louis
2) Use Matplotlib to project those in coordinates in Geographic space and in travel-time space.
